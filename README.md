# Joblog

The Joblog library provides a simple logging system. Itâ€™s ideal for batch jobs but can also be used
for longer running systems.

## Features

* Log format compatible with [Google Logging Library](https://github.com/google/glog).
* Log files are automatically written to a directory tree arranged by date with unique names.
* Available for several programming languages.
* Status lines logged automatically at start and exit.

## Example

This example demonstrates many of the features:

```

```

* The log is written to standard error as well as to the log file.
* All times are in UTC.
* The format is "<level><month/day> <time> [RSS] message".
* The log file name contains the date, time, program name, pid, and hostname. The resulting tree is
  safe to rsync to a central store where it will not overwrite logs from other jobs or machines.
* The first lines show the environment and command line.
* The last line shows run time, IO stats, and memory usage.

## Usage

### Javascript (Node)

```
npm install jamesbursa/joblog
```

```
var joblog = require("joblog");
joblog.info("processed %i/%i", i + 1, total);
joblog.warn("final sum %i", sum);
```

### Python

```
import joblog
import logging

logging.info("%i/%i (%.1f%%) processed", i + 1, total, 100.0 * (i + 1) / total)
logging.warn("all done")
```

Compatible with Python 2 and 3.
